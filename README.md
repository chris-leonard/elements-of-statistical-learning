# The Elements of Statistical Learning

These are my notes and exercise solutions from studying the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. The book can be downloaded free online at the following link:

My solutions to exercises were created using Jupyter notebooks. Given differences in how Jupyter and GitHub render LaTeX in .ipynb files, I recommend reading the .pdf files in GitHub.
